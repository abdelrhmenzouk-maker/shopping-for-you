# Shopping for you — Final (Ready to Upload)

This package is a ready-to-upload static site (no build step).

Files included:
- index.html
- styles.css
- app.js
- logo.png (your logo)

Features:
- Bilingual (English / Arabic) with automatic detection of visitor language (based on browser locale).
- Elegant/fancy styling using Playfair Display + Poppins fonts.
- Animated hero and CTA, Shop Now button that scrolls to the (currently empty) products section.
- RTL support for Arabic. Products section is intentionally empty for you to add items later.

How to deploy (quick):
1. Create a GitHub repository and upload these files (or use "Add file → Upload files").
2. Go to https://vercel.com → New Project → Import your GitHub repo → Deploy.
3. Site will be live; edit files in GitHub to change content and push updates automatically.

If you want, I can provide step-by-step screenshots for uploading to GitHub & Vercel.
